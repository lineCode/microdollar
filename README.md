MicroDollar: $1 Gesture Recognizer C++ port with optimizations for embedded hardware
======================
MicroDollar makes it possible to use the template-based $1 gesture recognizer on
resource-constrained microcontrollers, such as the ESP8266, Arduino Uno, and others.

This library was initially developed for the [SpeckleSense/SpeckleEye](http://olwal.com/#high-speed_embedded_motion_sensing) research projects at MIT. 

SpeckleSense exploits laser speckle sensing for precise, high-speed, low-latency motion tracking, which can be applied to a wide range of interaction scenarios and devices.

The work is based on the [$1 Unistroke Recognizer project](http://depts.washington.edu/madlab/proj/dollar/) at University of Washington/Microsoft Research.
